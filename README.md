Sure 👍 Here’s a **detailed, interview-ready explanation** of your **Shop_Finder project**, clearly highlighting the **technical skills**, **architecture**, and **your role**. You can use this in **technical rounds** or when the interviewer asks *“Explain your project”*.

---

## 🔹 Project Title: **Shop_Finder**

### 📌 **Project Overview**

**Shop_Finder** is a full-stack web application designed to help users easily find shops near their location, while allowing shop owners to register and manage their shop details online. The main goal of this project is to bridge the gap between local shop owners and nearby customers using a simple and efficient digital platform.

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Many local shops do not have an online presence, making it difficult for customers to discover nearby services. At the same time, customers often struggle to find relevant shops in their locality quickly. **Shop_Finder** solves this by providing:

* A location-based shop search for customers
* A self-registration system for shop owners

---

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**

### 🔹 **Backend (Spring Boot)**

* **Spring Boot** for creating RESTful APIs
* **Spring MVC** for request handling
* **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate** for ORM
* **MySQL** as the relational database
* **CRUD operations** for shop and user management
* **Exception handling & validations**

### 🔹 **Frontend (React)**

* **React.js** for building dynamic UI
* **Functional components & hooks**
* **Axios** for API integration
* **Responsive UI** for better user experience

### 🔹 **Database**

* **MySQL**
* Tables for:

  * Shop details (name, category, location, contact info)
  * Shop owner details
* Proper use of **primary keys, foreign keys**, and indexing

---

## 🧩 **System Architecture**

The project follows a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** – React frontend
2. **Application Layer** – Spring Boot REST APIs
3. **Data Layer** – MySQL database

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs, and the backend interacts with the database using JPA.
